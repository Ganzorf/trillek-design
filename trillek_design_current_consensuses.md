####  1.5.3  Game Content
  Aside from these major defining elements of the game, players would also be able to perform many tasks with their ship, including, but not limited to: mining for minerals on planets, asteroids and comets, salvaging abandoned starships and space stations, battling NPCs and other players both inside and outside of the ship, trading goods, technology and computer programs/data, and forming factions and guilds.


####  1.5.4  Theme
  Space and science-fiction.


####  1.5.5  Style
